# Bug Bugs for Good
In 20XX, tech companies continue to pollute the environment to make the world a better place - until they, the Bugs, stand up and bug them all!

In this stealth/puzzle game, you play as a Bug and crack all the servers in a tech company, while avoiding its security robot, Debuggers.
